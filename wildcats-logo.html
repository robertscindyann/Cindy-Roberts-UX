      <h2>Wildcats West Johnston High School Dance Team Logo</h2>

      <p>
        I designed a custom logo for the Wildcats Dance Team at West Johnston High School.
        The goal was to create a strong, unified identity that could be featured across
        apparel and team branding. The logo was approved by the coach and principal and is
        proudly worn by the team on t-shirts and used in group photos.
      </p>
      <h3>Identifying the Problem</h3>
      <p>
        The coach expressed concern that too many different versions of the Wildcats logo
        were in circulation, which created inconsistency across team materials. The goal of
        this project was to establish one cohesive and professional logo that could be used
        universally across apparel, bags, and promotional items.
      </p>
      <h3>Initial Sketches & Concept Development</h3>
      <p>
        I began the design process by sketching out multiple ideas to explore typography,
        mascot integration, and layout options. These rough sketches helped narrow down the
        direction for a strong, unified mark that would resonate with the team and represent
        their identity with pride.

      <h3>Project Impact</h3>
      <p>
        The logo not only elevated the team’s visual identity but also built team spirit.
        It demonstrated my ability to design professional branding elements that resonate
        with both students and leadership.
