      <h2>Case Study: Wildcats Dance Team Rebrand</h2>

      <!-- Project Overview -->
      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p>
        I was asked to design a new logo for the Wildcats Dance Team, a high school group
        seeking to refresh their identity. The coach wanted to explore a name change
        (“Engage”) and a crossword-style logo, but the team was already known as the Wildcats,
        the same as the school mascot. My role was to create a design that balanced her
        vision with school traditions and practical branding needs.
      </p>

      <!-- The Problem -->
      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Coach wanted a crossword-inspired design and considered renaming the team to “Engage.”</li>
        <li>“Engage” carried meaning but risked losing recognition tied to the school mascot.</li>
        <li>Crossword design was too complex for uniforms, embroidery, and signage.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Research & Inspiration -->
      <h3>Research & Inspiration</h3>
      <p>
        To ground my recommendations, I analyzed both <strong>college and high school dance team logos</strong>.
        The trend was clear: bold, simple marks (often a single letter) create instant recognition
        and scale well across apparel and digital platforms. This research gave me the evidence
        I needed to persuade stakeholders.

      <!-- Pushback & Collaboration -->
      <h3>Pushback & Collaboration</h3>
      <p>
        The coach was initially attached to her crossword sketch and the idea of a new name.
        I presented side-by-side comparisons of her concepts and simplified single-letter
        designs, walking through pros and cons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Crossword → meaningful, but hard to read, scale, or reproduce affordably.</li>
        <li>“Engage” → inspiring, but disconnected from school identity and mascot.</li>
        <li>Wildcats “W” → instantly recognizable, consistent with school branding, cost-effective.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This discussion allowed us to find middle ground: keeping the <strong>Wildcats identity</strong>
        while updating the logo for a modern, professional look.
      </p>

      <h3>Design Process: Sketches & Concepts</h3>
      <p>
        I began the design process by sketching multiple ideas to explore typography,
        mascot integration, and layout options. These explorations helped visualize different
        directions and refine toward a simpler, scalable identity that could adapt across uniforms,
        banners, and digital media.

      <h3>The Solution</h3>
      <p>
        The final logo features a bold, single “W” design representing the Wildcats.
        It was approved by the coach and principal, and rolled out across uniforms,
        warm-ups, and banners. <strong>This gave me real-world launch experience,
          managing not only design but stakeholder alignment and production constraints.</strong>
