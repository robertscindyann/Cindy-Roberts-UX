      <h2>Wildcats West Johnston High School Dance Team Logo</h2>

      <p>
        I designed a custom logo for the Wildcats Dance Team at West Johnston High School.
        The goal was to create a strong, unified identity that could be featured across
        apparel and team branding. The logo was approved by the coach and principal and is
        proudly worn by the team on t-shirts and used in group photos.
      </p>

      <div class="project-images">
        <img alt="Wildcats Dance Team wearing logo shirts">
        <img src="image/DanceLogoMockup.png" alt="Wildcats Dance Team Logo Design Mockup">
      </div>

      <h3>Project Impact</h3>

        The logo not only elevated the team’s visual identity but also built team spirit.
