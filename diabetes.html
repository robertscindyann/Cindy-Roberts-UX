      <h2>Case Study: Diabetes Awareness for Teens</h2>
      <p>
        For my passion project, I designed an educational website aimed at high school students to raise awareness about
        type 2 diabetes. Since more than 5,700 kids and teens (ages 10–19) are diagnosed each year, I wanted to create a
        platform that makes this complex topic easier to understand and encourages healthier choices.
      </p>

      <!-- The Problem -->
      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>Diabetes information online is often:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Overly medical → hard for teens to relate to</li>
        <li>Text-heavy → not engaging for a younger audience</li>
        <li>Adult-focused → most resources target parents or healthcare providers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>High school students need simple, engaging, and relatable content that connects to their everyday life (sports,
        snacks, energy levels).</p>

      <!-- Research & Insights -->
      <h3>Research & Insights</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>I reviewed CDC and ADA (American Diabetes Association) resources to ensure medical accuracy.</li>
        <li>I spoke informally with teens and parents to understand what motivates teens to care about health.</li>
        <li>Key insight: visuals, interactivity, and clear “what this means for me” messaging are crucial for
          engagement.</li>
      </ul>

      <div>
        <h3>User Interviews</h3>
        <p>
          I interviewed high school students to better understand their awareness of diabetes.
          The findings revealed important knowledge gaps and shaped how I designed the site.
        </p>

        <div class="research-insights">
          <div class="insight-card">
            <h4>Knowledge Gap</h4>
            <p>Most students didn’t know what the pancreas does or how the body uses food for energy.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="insight-card">
            <h4>Insulin Awareness</h4>
            <p>Students had heard of insulin but couldn’t explain its role clearly.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="insight-card">
            <h4>Education Need</h4>
            <p>They believed diabetes basics should be taught in high school health classes.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="insight-card">
            <h4>Relevance Perception</h4>
            <p>They thought diabetes mainly affects overweight people and didn’t see themselves at risk.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <!-- Design Goals -->
      <h3>Design Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Simplify language → use a conversational tone, avoid jargon.</li>
        <li>Visual-first learning → diagrams, icons, and images to explain concepts.</li>
        <li>Relatability → highlight activities and foods teens recognize.</li>
        <li>Actionable choices → show how lifestyle changes (sports, superfoods) connect to prevention.</li>
        <li>Ensure accessibility with high-contrast colors, alt text, keyboard navigation, and plain language.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Design Process -->
      <h3>Design Process</h3>
      <!-- Information Architecture -->
      <h4>Information Architecture (Hub-and-Spoke)</h4>
      <p>
        I structured the website using a <strong>hub-and-spoke model</strong>. The homepage acts as the hub,
        giving a clear overview, while subpages (spokes) allow users to dive deeper into focused topics:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>What is Diabetes?</strong> — Simple introduction with plain language.</li>
        <li><strong>How the Body Works</strong> — Visuals showing the pancreas and insulin process.</li>
        <li><strong>Food → Energy</strong> — Relatable examples using everyday foods.</li>
        <li><strong>Effects on Daily Life</strong> — Icons illustrating symptoms like thirst and fatigue.</li>
        <li><strong>Prevention Tips</strong> — Actionable steps, such as exercise and superfoods.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This approach ensures teens can explore topics at their own pace without feeling overwhelmed.</p>

      <!-- Wireframing & Layout -->
      <h4>Wireframing & Layout</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>I started with low-fidelity sketches to plan the hierarchy of content.</li>
        <li>Focused on short sections + strong visuals so users wouldn’t feel overwhelmed.</li>
      </ul>


      <h4>Visual Design</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Colors: Used bold, high-contrast colors for accessibility and energy.</li>
        <li>Typography: Chose Roboto for a clean, modern look that reads easily on screens.</li>
        <li>Imagery: Real teens in action (sports, classroom, daily life) + icons to reinforce key ideas.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Accessibility Considerations -->
      <h4>Accessibility Considerations</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Readable fonts: Chose Roboto with generous line spacing for easy scanning.</li>
        <li>Color contrast: Used high-contrast colors to ensure text is legible against backgrounds (helpful for
          color-blind users).</li>
        <li>Alt text: Added descriptive alt tags to all images and icons so screen readers can convey meaning.</li>
        <li>Skip navigation link: Included a “Skip to main content” link for users navigating with keyboards.</li>
        <li>Video content: Embedded an educational video but ensured text explanations were also present for users who
          can’t access audio.</li>
        <li>Plain language: Used simple, conversational text to reduce cognitive load, making it easier for both teens
          and users with reading difficulties.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Prototype & Development -->
      <h4>Prototype & Development</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Interactive mockups created in Figma.</li>
        <li>Final site built with HTML5, CSS3, and responsive design for all devices.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- The Solution -->
      <h3>The Solution</h3>
      <p>A responsive educational website that helps teens:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand what diabetes is (without medical jargon).</li>
        <li>See how it affects the body through visuals and icons.</li>
        <li>Learn prevention tips through relatable actions (basketball, choosing healthy foods).</li>
        <li>Stay engaged with a mix of text, images, and video content.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Reflection & Next Steps -->
      <h3>Reflection & Next Steps</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>What worked: The balance of visuals + short copy made the content approachable for a younger audience.
        </li>
        <li>What I’d improve: Add interactive elements like quizzes (“Is this a superfood?”), gamified challenges
          (track
          your weekly activity), or peer stories.</li>
        <li>Impact potential: With more testing in schools or health clubs, this could become a tool for early
          diabetes
          prevention education.</li>
      </ul>
