          <li><strong>Role:</strong> UX Designer</li>
          <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> 1 week</li>

      <p>
        This case study showcases the design of a <strong>mobile banking app onboarding experience</strong> for Haven
        Financial — a conceptual brand emphasizing trust, simplicity, and clarity. The goal was to create an intuitive,
        step-by-step flow that helps users <strong>open and fund a new checking account</strong> while feeling secure
        and informed.
      </p>

      <!-- The Problem -->
      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p class="callout">
        Many users abandon banking apps due to confusing verification steps and unclear progress.
        The challenge was to design a <strong>streamlined, confidence-building flow</strong> that made setup easy,
        secure, and transparent. This assumption was reinforced by secondary research and app review analysis,
        which revealed frustration around unclear guidance and lack of trust in digital banking.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Users often feel anxious about sharing sensitive information online.</li>
        <li>Complex forms and unclear instructions lead to frustration and drop-off.</li>
        <li>Trust is crucial in financial services, especially for first-time users.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Research Validation & Design Goals -->
      <h3>Research Validation & Design Goals</h3>
      <p>
        As a conceptual UX project, this work was informed by <strong>secondary research</strong> and competitive
        analysis of leading personal finance apps such as Mint, YNAB, and Empower. By analyzing app store reviews, UX
        articles, and discussions in personal finance communities, I identified recurring patterns around user trust,
        complexity, and motivation.
      </p>

      <h4>Key Insights</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Users feel <strong>anxious sharing financial data</strong> when the app lacks transparent communication or
          visual reassurance.</li>
        <li>Excessive form fields and unclear verification steps <strong>increase friction and abandonment
            rates</strong>.</li>
        <li>Visual simplicity and clear progress indicators <strong>boost perceived trust and confidence</strong>.</li>
      </ul>

        <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          To inform Haven’s onboarding strategy, I compared leading finance apps—Mint, YNAB, and Empower—across key UX
          criteria related to trust, clarity, and effort.

        <p class="table-summary">
          This analysis revealed that apps like YNAB achieved higher trust through transparency and calm design,
          while Mint’s longer onboarding and technical tone created friction. These findings guided Haven’s focus
          on simplicity, reassurance, and visual calm.

      <h4>Design Goals</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Trust-building:</strong> Use color, tone, and microcopy to reassure users through secure steps.</li>
        <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Make each step purpose-driven and visually distinct.</li>
        <li><strong>Progress visibility:</strong> Help users see where they are in the process.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Minimize input fields and leverage smart defaults.</li>
        <li><strong>Visual calm:</strong> Apply Haven’s navy blue and teal palette to evoke stability and ease.</li>

      <!-- User Flow -->
      <h3>User Flow</h3>

      <!-- Key UX Decisions -->
      <h3>Key UX Decisions</h3>
      <p>
        Each UX decision focused on making the onboarding process feel guided, secure, and rewarding — balancing trust
        with a frictionless experience.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Guided Simplicity:</strong> Each screen focused on one clear action at a time, preventing cognitive
          overload and allowing users to move forward confidently.</li>
        <li><strong>Trust Through Visual Language:</strong> The navy and teal palette provided calm and credibility,
          while white space and soft gradients created a professional yet welcoming interface.</li>
        <li><strong>Progress & Reassurance:</strong> A three-step progress indicator — <em>“Step 1 of 3: Personal Info,”
            “Step 2 of 3: Verify,” and “Step 3 of 3: Funding”</em> — reinforced momentum and transparency.</li>
        <li><strong>Microcopy & Tone:</strong> Plain, human language such as “We’re verifying your information securely”
          helped users feel safe without overwhelming them with compliance terms.</li>
        <li><strong>Inline Feedback:</strong> Real-time form validation and green success states provided immediate
          reassurance that details were entered correctly.</li>
        <li><strong>Completion Reinforcement:</strong> The success screen featured a checkmark icon, the heading
          <em>“Your checking account has been funded!”</em>, body text <em>“You can now start using your new Haven
            Checking account.”</em>, and a single <em>Done</em> button — giving users closure and a sense of
          achievement.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Impact -->
      <h3>Impact</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Increased confidence</strong> through consistent microcopy and visual cues.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced form friction</strong> by simplifying input fields and progress visibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Established scalability</strong> for future product extensions like loans or savings.</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Research Limitations -->
      <h3>Research Limitations & Next Steps</h3>

      <p>
        Because Haven Financial was a conceptual project, I used <strong>assumptive and secondary research</strong>
        rather than direct user interviews. Future iterations would include <strong>usability testing</strong> and
        <strong>moderated interviews</strong> to validate clarity, trust signals, and task completion rates.
      </p>

      <!-- Reflection -->
      <h3>Reflection & Next Steps</h3>
      <p>
        This project helped me strengthen my ability to design for trust — balancing financial compliance with emotional
        reassurance.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Next Iteration:</strong> Expand usability testing to validate clarity and error handling.</li>
        <li><strong>Future Direction:</strong> Extend Haven into a personalized dashboard experience integrating savings
          and credit tracking.</li>
      </ul>
